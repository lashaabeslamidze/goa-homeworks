#1Implement a function which convert the given boolean value into its string representation.

# Note: Only valid inputs will be given.

def boolean_to_string(b):
    return str(b)

#==============================
#2 Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

# [Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]

    return f'Hello, {name} how are you doing today?'

#===============================================================================
#3 This code does not execute properly. Try to figure out why.

def multiply(a, b):
    return (a * b)

#================================
#4 Very simple, given a number (integer / decimal / both depending on the language), find its opposite (additive inverse).

def opposite(number):
    return -number

#======================================

#5 You are given the length and width of a 4-sided polygon. The polygon can either be a rectangle or a square.
# If it is a square, return its area. If it is a rectangle, return its perimeter.

# Example(Input1, Input2 --> Output):


def area_or_perimeter(l , w):
    return l * w if l == w else (l + w) * 2
